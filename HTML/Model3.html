			The Tesla Model 3 is an electric four-door sedan developed by Tesla. The Model 3 Standard Range Plus version delivers an EPA-rated all-electric range of 250 miles (402 km) and the Long Range versions deliver 322 miles (518 km). At least one Model 3 was driven 606.2 miles (975 km) on a single charge.

		<p id = "paragraf">
			Model 3 is fully electric, so you never need to visit a gas station again. If you charge overnight at home, you can wake up to a full battery every morning.And when you’re on the road, it’s easy to plug in along the way at any public station or with the Tesla charging network.

				Built for Safety
			</h2>
			<p id = "safe3">
				Safety is the most important part of the overall Model 3 design. The metal structure is a combination of aluminum and steel, for maximum strength in every area. In a roof-crush test, Model 3 resisted four times its own mass, even with an all-glass roof: that's the same weight as two full-grown African elephants.

				Quickest Acceleration

			<p id="parvideo2">
					Model 3 comes with the option of dual motor all-wheel drive, 20” Performance Wheels and Brakes and lowered suspension for total control, in all weather conditions. And a carbon fiber spoiler improves stability at high speeds, all allowing Model 3 to accelerate from 0-60 mph in as little as 3.2 seconds.
